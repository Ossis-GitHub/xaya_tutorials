# Getting Started with XAYA

To start, download and install the latest [XAYA Electron wallet here](https://github.com/xaya/xaya_electron/releases) if you're on Windows, or the the [XAYA QT wallet](https://github.com/xaya/xaya/releases) if you're on Linux or Mac. The wallets automatically run the XAYA daemon, i.e. xayad.

If you run the QT or xayad, you'll need to set flags manually. They're automatically set in the Electron wallet. For more information on flags, see the [Daemon Flags tutorial](Daemon%20Flags.md).

Run the wallet or xayad and give it time to fully synchronise. 

You should also get some CHI. You can buy CHI at Liquid.com or ask in the Development forum. 1 CHI is lots more than enough to get started.
