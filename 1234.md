# Getting Started with XAYA

There are 4 steps to get started:

1. Get a XAYA wallet or xayad
2. Get libxayagame
3. Wire up libxayagame and RPC
4. Implement libxayagame's callbacks

## Get a XAYA Wallet or xayad

To start, download and install the latest [XAYA Electron wallet here](https://github.com/xaya/xaya_electron/releases) if you're on Windows, or the the [XAYA QT wallet](https://github.com/xaya/xaya/releases) if you're on Linux or Mac. The wallets automatically run the XAYA daemon, i.e. xayad.

If you run the QT or xayad, you'll need to set flags manually. They're automatically set in the Electron wallet. For more information on flags, see the [Daemon Flags tutorial](Daemon%20Flags.md).

Run the wallet or xayad and give it time to fully synchronise. 

You should also get some CHI. You can buy CHI at Liquid.com or ask in the Development forum. 1 CHI is lots more than enough to get started. 

## Get libxayagame

The libxayagame library provides notifications to your game whenever new blocks are mined. You can [download libxayagame from its Github repository here](https://github.com/xaya/libxayagame). Precompiled statically linked libxayagame binaries for Windows are available [here](). A C# wrapper for libxayagame is available [here]().

## Wire Up libxayagame and RPC

In your project, add a reference for the libxayagame library and call it's constructor. In C++ the constructor looks like this:

	const int res = xaya::DefaultMain (config, "mv", rules);

In C#, you need to call the constructor and then call its Connect method. 

            // Launch the wrapper in a thread.
            string result = string.Empty;
            wrapper = new XayaWrapper(dataPath, // The path to XayaStateProcessor
                Properties.Settings.Default.Host, // The host, e.g. localhost or 127.0.0.1
                "8900", // The game host port. Fixed at 8900 in libxayagame.
                ref result, // An error or success message.
                CallbackFunctions.initialCallbackResult, 
                CallbackFunctions.forwardCallbackResult, 
                CallbackFunctions.backwardCallbackResult);

            // This is a blocking operation, so it must run in it's own thread.
            result = wrapper.Connect(dataPath, // The path to XayaStateProcessor
                FLAGS_xaya_rpc_url, // The URL for RPC calls.
                "8900",  // The game host port. Fixed at 8900 in libxayagame.
                "0", // Which network to use: Mainnet, Testnet, or Regtestnet.
                "memory", // The storage type: memory, sqlite, or lmdb.
                "helloworld", // The name of the game in the 'g/' namespace.
                dataPath + "\\..\\XayaStateProcessor\\database\\", // Path to the database folder, e.g. SQLite.
                dataPath + "\\..\\XayaStateProcessor\\glogs\\"); // Path to glog output folder.
