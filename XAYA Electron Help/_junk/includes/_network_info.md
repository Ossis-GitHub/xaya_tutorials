* **Connections:** Shows how many active connections you have to other XAYA nodes 
around the world.
* **Net Type:** Tells you whether you are on mainnet (this is where you play games) or 
on testnet (this is where testing is done).
* **Is Pruned?:** Tells you whether you're running with the full blockchain (false) or 
with a shorter version (true).
* **Median Time:** Just the time. It updates periodically, and not in real time.
