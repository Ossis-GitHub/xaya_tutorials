## Fix Sync Problems

There are different reasons why your wallet may get stuck synchronising. 

Advanced users may wish to run the wallet from the command line with a "-reindex" and/or "-rescan" option. 

You can also delete the blockchain data and resynchronise. See [Delete Chain](#delete-chain) for more information.
